        details: ['If your main point character is damaged, you will see a blue health bar that represents recoverable health. You can recover this health  by either sparking (which isnt the most optimal but sometimes the right choice) or you can tag in another characater. ','While not on point, characters will slowly recover any blue health available. Keep in mind, your opponent knows this and if they snap them in all blue health is lost.'],

        details: ['Guard Cancel is a rather strong defensive tool, given it is used in the correct situations. Activated by hitting forward(6) during blockstun and an assist, the chosen assist will dash out toward the enemy. They do not take any hits, except from anti-airs, and will continue until hitting the enemy. Guard canceling requires you spend a bar of meter to initiate it.','Sounds strong right? It is. However, if the opponent blocks your attempt to swap, you will get punished and potentially lose a character.'],

        title: 'Can I get them away from me without spending a bar?',
        details: ['Reflect activates immediately and will push opponents away if they are hitting with strikes, or just "push" beams and ki-blasts away. Reflect does not cost a bar, however requires you be in a standing state, pressing back (4) and Special (S). 4 + S.','A powerful defensive tool, but is it full-proof? No, this is part of the rock, paper, scissors that is fighting games.'],

        details: ['Vanish! Vanish is activated by hitting M + H. Upon activation, you will teleport behind the enemy and strike them. This can be used both offensively and defensively. If there is a big enough gap you can punish an offensive opponents move. Be careful, just like other options this can be punished.'],

        details: ['Sliding knockdown is a state you enter at the end of an opponents combo that does not end in a level 3. Sliding knockdown lets you control in how and when you tech up, allowing you to influence and even force a mistake from your opponent, giving you the chance to flip your offense on.'],

Experience, character knowledge and frame data help you bolster your defense and make sound defensive options. Not every situation you are in defensively is real and sometimes you have more options than you realize.'],

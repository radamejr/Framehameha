        details: ['Neutral involves a couple different ideas clumped together that create a mindgame and interactions between you and your opponent. Generally speaking, when neither player is in an advantagous state but you are making decisions and movement to gain it, you are playing "footsies".','The idea behind footsies is while not putting yourself at risk, getting your opponent to make a move that puts them in a punishable state. This can be whiffing buttons to force a reaction, running up and blocking, or jumping around.', 'If the opponent moves, or attacks and whiffs the move, you may be able to counter attack and begin doing damage. Another common idea is Advantage/Disadvantage. Advantage and Disadvantage are directly inverse. If you have your opponent blocking, or you are pummeling their face in, you are in the Advantage state and the opponent is at a Disadvantage.'],

        details: ['Superdash has a bad reputation out in the Netplay streets as being an "EZ Neutral" button. It does have some strength to it and creates a new problem to think about during neutral, however I would not say it is an end all button. Paired with an assist Superdash becomes a very powerful tool that can feel overwhelming.','But, here are some things to think about, How can we punish it? How can we use it?'],

        details: ['Combos are great, they feel good and help you on your quest for world domination(defending the universe). However, you first have to hit your opponent before you can move into doing your awesome combos. How do we get a hit? Is there some sort of trick? A gambit? An aggreement? No. You must mix-up your opponent.','According to dotesports, a mix-up is defined as "A mix up refers to a combination that uses a number of different attacks (high, low, overhead, throw,) which a require specific defenses to guard against. Certain mix ups can be exceptionally difficult to block, which makes them one of the foundational strategies in fighting games". How to I make a good mix-up?'],

Every fighting game (tecnically any game) has Frame Data. Every move requies a certain amount of frames before it hits, how long it hits, and how long it takes before you can do another action.'],
